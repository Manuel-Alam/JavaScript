Comments on code:

When on the drop off an item page, please choose an item before a number of items is selected.
If you don't do this then the find fridges button will not enable.

Not really too sure what happens if you click the one of the available fridges a lot of times,
could possibly cause issues with program. Please be careful. (some error checking is probably missing)

When the add an item page is pressed you will notice the Add an item button is always enabled,
so this allows for any input to be added to the items json file. (even blank items can be added)


In conclusion, I have created all the functionallity for this assignment with bits of error checking missing.
