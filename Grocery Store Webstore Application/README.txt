Comments on code:
The catergories of my code were hard coded because it said we were allowed to in the in assignmentworkshop 
on brightspace. 

As a result, all lot of the code was built around those 6 hard coded categories, so I would suggest
testing with those categories hard coded.

Everything else though was dynamic. For example, The number of fridges is dynamic, the number of each items
in a fridge is dynamic.

There should be nothing wrong with the code when testing and hopefully everything runs smoothly. :)
