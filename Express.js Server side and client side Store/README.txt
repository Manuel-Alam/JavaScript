Comments on code:

<addFridge.html>
the addFridges.html page has no error checking client.
the addFridges.html page has error checkign server side.
but the POST request fully works and creates a new fridge.

<editFridge.html>
the editFridges.html page has no error checking client.
the editFridges.html page has error checkign server side.
but the PUT request fully works and creates a new fridge.

<“Pick up an item” screen>
the button was implemented but wasnt finsihed.
the button has no functionality but will appear and reappear.
the delete request for this url works on the server but not on client.
